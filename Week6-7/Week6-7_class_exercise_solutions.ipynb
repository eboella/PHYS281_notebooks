    "**In this example we will examine the motion of a particle undergoing anharmonic oscillations.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Oscillating systems are ubiquitous in physics.  We can often approximate that small-amplitude oscillations are described by simple harmonic oscillators with potential energy $U(x)=\\frac{1}{2}kx^2$, where $k$ is the spring constant, because potential wells are generally quadratic about their minima in accordance with Taylor's theorem.  However, for larger amplitudes, we can no longer assume that the potential energy is quadratic and hence we have an **anharmonic oscillator**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose particle of mass m moves in a *quartic* potential energy\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U(x) = \\frac{1}{2}kx^2 + ax^3 + bx^4,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k$ and $b$ are positive constants and $a$ is a constant that may be of either sign.  Physically, the cubic and quartic terms in the potential arise from retaining higher-order terms in the Taylor expansion of the potential energy about its minimum.  Often we can assume that $a$ and $b$ are small, but not necessarily negligible.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid confusion, we shall assume that all quantities are in SI units.  (In \"real life\" it is often useful to choose appropriate units that give sensible numbers; e.g., in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics we often use Hartree atomic units in which the numerical values of the electron mass $m_{\\rm e}$, magnitude of electronic charge $|e|$, permittivity $4\\pi\\epsilon_0$ and reduced Planck constant $\\hbar$ all take value 1.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduce a class for anharmonic oscillators, holding the potential parameters and including methods to return the potential and the force due to the potential, as well as a method to plot the potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Can you add a method to plot the force as a function of particle position?**\n",
    "\n",
    "When we model this anharmonic oscillator, we assume that we still have just a single minimum at $x=0$ in the potential.  **Can you derive a condition on the cubic coefficient $a$ to ensure that no additional stationary points are introduced?**  Hints: (i) at stationary points the force on the particle is zero; (ii) use the discriminant of a quadratic to ensure that no additional stationary points are introduced.  **Can you add some code to raise a value error in the __init__ method if parameter values that would lead to additional stationary points are supplied.**"
